## 🛠️ Development Workflow Integration

### Git Workflow Integration

All platforms support modern Git workflows:

```bash
# Development workflow
git checkout -b feature/new-scene
# Make changes to your game
git commit -m "Add new dialogue scene"
git push origin feature/new-scene
# Create pull request → Automatic preview deployment
# Merge to main → Automatic production deployment
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Example** (works with all platforms):
```yaml
name: Deploy Game
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd web-version && npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd web-version && npm test
      - name: Build project
        run: cd web-version && npm run build
      - name: Deploy to [Platform]
        # Platform-specific deployment step
```

## 🎮 Game-Specific Deployment Features

### Save System Integration

Each platform handles game saves differently:

**Vercel/Netlify (Client-side):**
- Uses localStorage for save persistence
- Works offline but limited to single device
- Simple implementation, no backend required

**Appwrite (Cloud saves):**
- Persistent saves across all devices
- User authentication required
- Supports cloud sync and backup

### Performance Optimization

**Bundle Size Optimization:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size before deployment
cd web-version
npm run build
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist
```

**Asset Optimization:**
- Images automatically optimized on Vercel
- Netlify provides image transformation API
- Appwrite includes built-in image processing

### SEO & Social Media

All platforms include proper meta tags for:
- **Search engine optimization**
- **Social media sharing** (Twitter cards, Facebook OpenGraph)
- **Progressive Web App** manifest

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring

**Built-in Analytics:**
- **Vercel**: Speed Insights, Web Vitals tracking
- **Netlify**: Site analytics, form submissions
- **Appwrite**: Function executions, database queries

**External Analytics Integration:**
```javascript
// Google Analytics 4 integration (works with all platforms)
gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
  page_title: 'Echoes of Ellidra',
  page_location: window.location.href
});

// Track game events
gtag('event', 'game_start', {
  event_category: 'engagement',
  event_label: 'new_game'
});
```

### Error Tracking

```javascript
// Sentry integration example
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
});

// Track game-specific errors
Sentry.captureException(new Error("Game state corruption"));
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

**Secure configuration for all platforms:**
```env
# Client-side variables (prefixed with VITE_)
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Server-side variables (functions only)
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Content Security Policy

**Recommended CSP headers:**
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com; 
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
  img-src 'self' data: https:; 
  font-src 'self'; 
  connect-src 'self' https://cloud.appwrite.io;
```
