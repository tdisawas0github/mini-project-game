- 🧙‍♀️ You're the **First Speaker** - basically the person who invented magical language
- 🌨️ Set in **Valdaren** - a frost-wrapped world where words have literal power  
- 🔤 Master **Ellidric** - a constructed language that can manipulate memories and reality
- ⚔️ Navigate complex politics between factions who want to control vs protect this power
- 💭 Every dialogue choice rewrites someone's memories (including your own!)
