- **Easy to pronounce** with a fully phonetic writing system
- **Based on Thai grammar** without classifiers
- **Rich vocabulary** drawn from Hindi, English, Japanese, Latin, and Chinese

## Integration with Game Lore

This conlang builds upon the existing Ellidric concept from the game, where glyphs have four layers:
1. **Sound** — phonetic pronunciation
2. **Emotion** — emotional resonance  
3. **Mnemonic Tether** — memory connections
4. **Ethical Resonance** — moral implications

The language serves as both a practical communication system and a mystical force for memory manipulation in the world of Valdaren.
