# Ellidric Grammar

*The Structural Heart of the Language of Memory*

## Design Philosophy

Ellidric grammar is based on **Thai linguistic patterns** but simplified for easy learning. The core principles are:

1. **No grammatical gender** - Words don't change based on masculine/feminine
2. **No classifiers** - Unlike Thai, we don't use special counting words
3. **Context-heavy** - Meaning often derived from word order and context
4. **Analytical structure** - Grammar expressed through word order and particles, not inflection

## Word Order

### Basic Pattern: **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)**

**Ellidric**: *Kanu velu ithara.*  
**English**: "I remember you."
- *kanu* = I  
- *velu* = remember/memory
- *ithara* = you

This follows the same pattern as English, making it intuitive for English speakers.

## Particles & Function Words

Ellidric uses **particles** (small grammatical words) to show relationships, similar to Thai:

### Essential Particles

| Particle | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **na** | question marker | *Kanu velu na?* = "Do I remember?" |
| **ka** | politeness/respect | *Velu ka* = "Remember (politely)" |
| **lo** | past tense | *Kanu velu lo* = "I remembered" |
| **va** | future tense | *Kanu velu va* = "I will remember" |
| **se** | continuous aspect | *Kanu velu se* = "I am remembering" |
| **ma** | negation | *Kanu ma velu* = "I don't remember" |
| **en** | possessive | *Kanu en velu* = "My memory" |

## Verb System

### No Conjugation!
Verbs **never change form** - context and particles show time and aspect.

**Root verb**: *velu* (remember)
- Present: *Kanu velu* = "I remember"  
- Past: *Kanu velu lo* = "I remembered"
- Future: *Kanu velu va* = "I will remember"
- Continuous: *Kanu velu se* = "I am remembering"
- Negative: *Kanu ma velu* = "I don't remember"

### Common Verbs

| Ellidric | English | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *velu* | remember/know | *Kanu velu ithara* = "I remember you" |
| *mera* | love/feel | *Ithara mera kanu* = "You love me" |
| *kala* | speak/say | *Kanu kala* = "I speak" |
| *tanu* | come/go | *Kanu tanu* = "I come/go" |
| *dara* | give/take | *Kanu dara ithara* = "I give (to) you" |
| *helu* | see/look | *Kanu helu* = "I see" |
| *nira* | be/exist | *Kanu nira* = "I am/exist" |

## Noun System

### No Articles
Ellidric has **no words for "a" or "the"** - context determines specificity.

*velu* can mean:
- "memory" (general concept)
- "a memory" (one specific memory)  
- "the memory" (specific memory being discussed)

### Plurals
Add **-te** to make nouns plural:

- *velu* = memory → *velute* = memories
- *manu* = person → *manute* = people  
- *kira* = word → *kirate* = words

### Possession 
Use **en** particle:

- *Kanu en velu* = "My memory"
- *Ithara en manu* = "Your person/friend"
- *Manu en kira* = "The person's words"

## Adjectives

Adjectives come **after** the noun they describe:

- *velu mora* = "warm memory" (*mora* = warm)
- *manu ketu* = "good person" (*ketu* = good)  
- *kira delu* = "dark words" (*delu* = dark)

### Comparison
- **Comparative**: Add *-mer* suffix  
  *mora* = warm → *moramer* = warmer
- **Superlative**: Add *-mest* suffix  
  *mora* = warm → *moramest* = warmest

## Questions

### Yes/No Questions
Add **na** particle at the end:

*Ithara velu kanu na?* = "Do you remember me?"

### WH-Questions
Question words typically go at the **beginning**:

| Question Word | English | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| *kelu* | what | *Kelu ithara velu?* = "What do you remember?" |
| *melu* | who | *Melu tanu?* = "Who comes?" |
| *telu* | where | *Telu ithara nira?* = "Where are you?" |
| *helu* | when | *Helu kanu tanu?* = "When do I come?" |
| *yelu* | why | *Yelu ithara mera kanu?* = "Why do you love me?" |
| *velu-kelu* | how | *Velu-kelu kanu kala?* = "How do I speak?" |

## Complex Sentences

### Connecting Ideas
Use **connecting particles**:

| Connector | English | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **ru** | and | *Kanu velu ru mera* = "I remember and love" |
| **ho** | but | *Kanu velu ho ma mera* = "I remember but don't love" |
| **su** | because | *Kanu mera su ithara ketu* = "I love because you're good" |
| **ji** | if | *Ji ithara tanu, kanu mera* = "If you come, I love" |

### Relative Clauses
Use **thi** to connect descriptive clauses:

*Manu thi velu kanu* = "The person who remembers me"
*Velu thi kanu mera* = "The memory that I love"

## Mystical Grammar

### Sacred Word Order (VSO)
In ritual or mystical contexts, Ellidric can shift to **Verb-Subject-Object** for emphasis:

**Normal**: *Kanu velu ithara* = "I remember you"  
**Mystical**: *Velu kanu ithara* = "Remember I you" (more powerful/formal)

### Memory Binding Structures
Special grammar for memory manipulation:

**Memory Query**: *Velu-na [memory] telu?* = "Where-memory [X]?"
- *Velu-na kanu en nama telu?* = "Where is my name-memory?"

**Memory Command**: *Velu-ka [target] [memory]*  
- *Velu-ka ithara mora-velu* = "Remember (you) warm-memory"

## Example Sentences

### Basic Communication
1. *Kanu nira Kael* = "I am Kael"
2. *Ithara tanu telu?* = "Where do you come from?"  
3. *Manu ketu mera kanu* = "A good person loves me"
4. *Kanu ma velu ithara en nama* = "I don't remember your name"

### Mystical/Game Context
1. *Velu-ka kanu mora-ithara en kira* = "Memory-command I warm your words"
2. *Ellidric kira melu-ka manute?* = "Ellidric words who-commands people?"
3. *Kanu en velu ma nira, ho kira velu kanu* = "My memory doesn't exist, but words remember me"
