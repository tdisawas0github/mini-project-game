# Echoes of Ellidra – Lore Document

## 🌍 Setting: Valdaren
A frost‑bound land where **language shapes reality**. Snow‑choked forests, crystal lakes, and ancient ruins are etched with *Ellidric* glyphs that hum with latent power.

### Regions
- **Institute Territories** – Urban, codified knowledge; centered in Ravengard. The Institute seeks to catalogue and control Ellidric.
- **Clanlands** – Oral tradition keepers in Whispering Woods and Snowveil Forest. They view Ellidric as alive and untamable.
- **Forgotten Fringe** – Mythic borderlands near Lumisth Glacier and the Ancient Ruins; birthplace of Ellidric.

## 🔤 Ellidric – The Language of Memory
A constructed tongue of glyphs, each with four layers:
1. **Sound** – Phonetic form
2. **Emotion** – Feeling it carries
3. **Mnemonic Tether** – Memory it links to
4. **Ethical Resonance** – Moral/spiritual weight

**Effects of Speaking Ellidric:**
- Unlock buried memories
- Alter perception of reality
- Change loyalty, personality, or identity

> No single language fully translates Ellidric — English, Dutch, Classical Latin, and Modern Greek each reveal different facets.

### Codex Ellidric (Institute Dialect)
- **Faction:** Institute of Lingua Arcanum

### Verdant Ellidric (Clan Dialect)
- **Faction:** Clans of the Whispering Woods
- **Traits:** Oral, tonal, rhythm‑based; glyphs sung or carved into living wood.
- **Cultural Notes:** Language is considered alive; meanings shift with performance.

### Glacial Ellidric (Fringe Dialect)
- **Faction:** Lumisth Glacier dwellers
- **Traits:** Sparse, symbolic; glyphs etched into ice/crystal, meaning changes with light.
- **Cultural Notes:** Used for ritual and prophecy; outsiders find it cryptic.

### Pure Ellidric (Echoborn Dialect)
