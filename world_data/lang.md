🎯 Usage in Game Design

Lore Integration: Each dialect ties directly to its faction’s culture and political role.

Mechanics: Puzzle types are unique per dialect, with potential for multi‑dialect combos.

UI Design: Colors and motifs ensure instant visual recognition of faction origin.

Quest Hooks: Each faction has at least one named NPC and a quest seed for expansion.

🔗 Combo Examples

Brine + Lumen: “Tidal Star Charts” (water + celestial navigation puzzles)

Cinder + Veil: “Ashforge Sigils” (heat‑reactive glyphs with fading memory traces)

Echo + Verdant: “Resonant Grove” (harmonic speech shaping living glyph growth)

🧭 Dialect Morph Guides

Codex Ellidric: Prefer CV/CVC; resolve clusters with epenthetic e; /th/ → t; neutral tone. Compounds with hyphenation; add -um for abstracts; -ar for agents. Glyphs with serif‑like angles, tidy baselines, registry marks.

Verdant Ellidric: Tonal diacritics; intervocalic lenition (k → g, t → d); vowel harmony. Reduplication for intensity; -ai for living forms; -eŋ for songs/rituals. Vine wraps, branching swashes, growth ticks in glyphs.

Glacial Ellidric: Vowel reduction (a → ɐ/ə); drop unstressed vowels; crisp fricatives. Zero‑copula compounds; temporal aspect via position. Faceted strokes, refracted splits, light “notches.”

Pure Ellidric: Preserve Proto contrasts; allow glottal breaks (’); shard‑like pacing. Juxtaposed compounds; rhythm/spacing carry meaning. Fragmented rune shards with prismatic glow.

Cinder Ellidric: Fortition (r → rr; k → q; v → b/f); final devoicing. Instrumental -at; craft nominalizer -ruk; clipped imperatives. Chisel cuts, heat cracks, soot halos.

Brine Ellidric: Liquids glide (r → l/rr); vowel lengthening; w~v assimilation. Locatives -ua/-sho; chant prefixes li‑, lu‑. Wave crests, spray dots, tidal arcs.

Zephyr Ellidric: Aspirate drift (add h; t → th; k → kh); elide finals. Motion suffix -el; breath particles ha, he. Ribbon strokes, wind curls, pennant tails.

Veil Ellidric: Vowel deletion; consonant skeletons; whispered schwas in speech. Secrecy infix -y‑; vanishing tense by timing, not text. Soft edges, smudge fades, negative space.

Echo Ellidric: Harmonic doubling (CV → CVCV); resonant finals -m/-n. Call‑and‑response compounds; resonance markers ː. Concentric rings, chamber arches, standing waves.

Lumen Ellidric: Vowel ablaut for aspect (a→e→i); consonants soften under “starlight.” Alignment cases -os (east), -an (zenith), -ur (west). Dot‑linked constellations, orbit lines, azimuth ticks.

🧩 Quick Derivation Prompts

Create a Factional Oath: Seed kel “bind”; target Veil Ellidric; result idea: k‑l with a timed fade, spoken as one breath and written as two fading strokes.

Make a Heat‑Reactive Weapon Name: Seed ruk “forge” + ar “call”; target Cinder Ellidric; result idea: rrukar, engraved with crack‑glow lines that light under heat.

Design a Tidal Prophecy Refrain: Seed lir “song” + dael “path”; target Brine Ellidric; result idea: lírua‑dáu, sung as currents rearrange glyphs.
