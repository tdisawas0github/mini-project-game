# 🧭 Setting — Valdaren
A frost‑wrapped land where language is more than communication — it’s a force that sculpts memory and reality.  
Snow‑choked forests, crystal lakes, and ancient ruins are etched with *Ellidric* glyphs that hum with latent power.

**Cultural Spheres**
- **Institute Territories** — Urban, codified knowledge, centered in **Ravengard**. The Institute seeks to catalogue and control Ellidric like a science.
- **Clanlands** — Oral tradition keepers in **Whispering Woods** and **Snowveil Forest**. They view Ellidric as alive, not to be tamed.
- **Forgotten Fringe** — Mythic borderlands near **Lumisth Glacier** and the **Ancient Ruins**, believed to be where Ellidric first touched human minds.

# 🔤 Ellidric — The Language of Memory
A constructed tongue of glyphs, each with four layers:
1. **Sound** — its phonetic form  
2. **Emotion** — the feeling it carries  
3. **Mnemonic Tether** — the memory it links to  
4. **Ethical Resonance** — the moral or spiritual weight of its use  

**Abilities when spoken:**
- Unlock buried memories
- Alter someone’s perception of reality
- Change loyalty, personality, or identity  

> *Note:* No single language fully translates Ellidric — English, Dutch, Classical Latin, and Modern Greek each expose different aspects.
